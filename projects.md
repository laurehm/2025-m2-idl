# Course Projects

## Overview

The course project accounts for **70% of your final grade**. You will work on a deep learning project in small groups, implementing and experimenting with recent techniques from the literature.

**Final presentation**: End of semester (30 minutes including Q&A)

## Evaluation Criteria

You are expected to:
- **Understand the method**: Demonstrate clear understanding of the technique and its theoretical foundations
- **Reproduce results**: Implement the method (or extend existing code) and reproduce key results from the paper
- **Experiment**: Conduct additional experiments
- **Analyze**: Critically analyze the results, discuss limitations, and suggest improvements
- **Present**: Deliver a clear 20-minute presentation + 10 minutes Q&A

## Custom Projects

You are welcome to propose your own project! If you have a specific paper or technique you'd like to explore (but let us discuss it first).

**Requirements for custom projects:**
- Must involve implementing/experimenting with deep learning methods
- Should be of comparable scope to the suggested projects
